The inspiration of the object is from a LED cube, which is an installation that I assembled.

Cubes are full of possibilities. I spend a long time playing Rubik's cube and Burr puzzles when I was little, I like thinking about how to move one thing to another position. So when I watched The movie ‘Cube’, it shocked me. Yes, It is terrible to see people die but the way that space moves are so charming, so I started thinking about how does the space had been squeezed into my cubes… I love to image stand under ‘Big Dumb Object’, it makes me, even human insignificant. Not only that but different dimensional space has also been described and shaped like cubes. Such as Five-dimensional space in ‘Interstellar’, space control ability in ‘Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba’ and hermetic space in ‘Room’. So I start thinking what could I do with my cube.

I moved the structure of the physical object into virtual space. It has the same feeling at first, but it looks not as good as the real one, it is bulky. So I start thinking about what’s the wall between those two spaces, the real and the virtual. Looking for something could bring the cube illusorily. Since I do not know what could open frameworks do, I started looking at Pinterest Instagram and Youtube. Then I found the ‘ofxCameraAnaglyph’.Drawing the cube in red and blue brings the early Red and blue 3d movie atmosphere. ]
